Student Ambassadors
 
This program was designed for the Concordia College Student Ambassador program.
 
It incorporates client data of student availability, work preference, and student attributes
such as major and interests.
 
Taking in all of the data, the program distributes the students over the work week in such a way as to maximize the minimum
number of attributes represented in a time bracket (ie - Monday Morning).
 
This way, a "snapshot" of Concordia is present at any given time and available to give tours to prospective students.
